# Getting Wiki Info

It's a simple program I built on Python that generates customized URL based on user input, webscrapes information from the person's wikipedia page, and returns the formatted information. 

## Getting Started

Make sure that you have the required dependencies mentioned below installed in your setup, download the repository and run the getwikiinfo.py script. You will be prompted with an interface that will allow you type somebody's name (basically anybody who has a wikipedia page).  

### Installing Dependencies

You will primarily need three libraries - tkinter (to build the GUI), requests (to send in HTTP requests), and Beautiful Soup (to parse the html file).

Tkinter comes with Python by defaults

```
pip install requests
```
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Running the tests

Simply run the getwikiinfo.py script. You will be prompted with a simple interface. 



## Built With

* [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) - GUI package
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - parsing the HTML file
